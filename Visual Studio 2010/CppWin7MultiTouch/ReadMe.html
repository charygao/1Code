<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This sample demonstrates how to use Windows 7 multi-touch to create a simple 
but modern image viewer. You can use your fingers to translate (pan), scale 
(zoom), rotate, and skew the image. The image is rendered using modern Windows 7 technologies such as Direct2D and WIC.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have a touch screen, the sample still allows you to perform very 
simple interactions with the image by clicking the ribbon commands using your mouse. 
In order to keep the code file simple, the sample does not implement complex 
mouse interactivity as you can find in programs such as Expression Design.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>For this sample to work, you must have Visual Studio 2010. You must use 
Windows 7. You also need to have a Windows 7 compatible multi-touch screen.</p>
<h2>Sample Relationships</h2>
<p>Windows 7 has built-in support for multi-touch screens. If you don&#39;t have 
much experience in using a multi-touch screen, it is highly recommended that you 
watch this video:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/using-windows-touch">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/using-windows-touch</a>. 
It tells you how to use multi-touch as an end user.</p>
<p>As a developer, you can also create your own applications that support 
multi-touch. You can use Windows native APIs in native applications, or you can 
use WPF APIs in managed applications. This sample uses native code. For a 
managed 
sample, please 
refer to the &quot;Creating Your First Touch Application&quot; tutorial on
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee649090.aspx">MSDN</a>. It 
walks through how to create a graphic viewer that supports multi-touch, similar 
to what we demonstrate in this sample. You can change the 
Rectangle in the tutorial to an Image, a MediaElement, or whatever you like.</p>
<p>In addition, we have a CS/VBWpf3DMultiTouch sample in All-In-One Code Framework, 
which demonstrates a more advanced 3D manipulation scenario using WPF. In native 
code, however, due to the complex of Direct3D, and the fact that there&#39;re no 
getting started tutorial on MSDN for native applications, we decided to create a simple 
but modern 2D image viewer sample that supports multi-touch.</p>
<p>You can also find several code samples in the 
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx">Windows SDK</a> 
demonstrating how to use multi-touch gestures, manipulations, and inertias. 
Those samples focus on the touching part. But to build a modern image viewer, 
it is recommended to use modern graphic APIs such as Direct2D and WIC. Direct2D 
allows you to take advantage of hardware acceleration, especially for 
transforms, which are used heavily in multi-touch enabled image viewers. So this 
sample focus on how to integrate multi-touch with Direct2D, instead of building 
a clone of the SDK samples. If you&#39;re not familiar with Direct2D, please refer 
to the Direct2D samples in the Windows SDK, and our CppWin7Direct2D sample in 
the All-In-One Code Framework.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The most important code files in the sample are D2DWindows.h and 
D2DWindow.cpp. It is in the D2DWindow that all touching and rendering occurs. 
There&#39;re 3 kinds of touch related concepts: raw touching messages, gestures, and 
manipulations. Note gestures 
cannot be used together with manipulations and raw touch messages, so this sample only demonstrates the 
gestures. But the document below will discuss all the concepts.</p>
<h3>Multi-touch</h3>
<h4>Raw touch messages</h4>
<p>You can handle the WM_TOUCH message directly. Unlike mouse, though, touch only 
generates a single WM_TOUCH message. There&#39;s no WM_TOUCH_DOWN, WM_TOUCH_MOVE, 
WM_TOUCH_UP, etc. This is different from managed code, where the raw touch 
events are encapsulated to simulate mouse events. You handle the WM_TOUCH message, and call the 
GetTouchInputInfo function to get the status of the touched points. This 
function contains an output parameter which returns an array of TOUCHINPUT 
structures. Each TOUCHINPUT represents one fingers. You can then obtain the 
status of each finger. For more information, please 
refer to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd317341(VS.85).aspx">
MSDN document</a>.</p>
<h4>Gesture messages</h4>
<p>If you&#39;re working with a 2D application, you can translate/rotate/scale the 
scene using the data reported in the gesture messages without any custom 
calculation! That&#39;s why we say touch is easier than mouse. There&#39;re several 
predefined gestures. This
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd940543(VS.85).aspx">MSDN 
document</a> provides a graphical description of all these gestures.</p>
<p>In order to work with gestures, first you need to handle the WM_GESTURENOTIFY 
message to tell the operating system what gestures you want to enable in your 
application. By default, gestures other than rotation and single finger pan are 
all enabled. This sample enables all gestures except the GC_PAN_WITH_GUTTER 
gesture. If GC_PAN_WITH_GUTTER is enabled, when you pan the image, touch engine 
tries its best to move the object along with a horizontal or vertical line. This 
is usually not an intended behavior in an image viewer application. For more 
information, please refer to the D2DWindow::OnGestureNotify method.</p>
<p>After you registered what gestures you want to enable, you can handle the 
WM_GESTURE message to handle the actual gestures. Please refer to the 
D2DWindows::OnGestureNotify method for more information.</p>
<p>Gestures cannot be used in managed code directly (without manual P/Invoke). 
The WPF managed API only exposes raw touch messages and manipulation.</p>
<h4>Manipulation and Intertia</h4>
<p>Manipulation allows your application to combine several gestures at the same 
time. For example, you can scale and translate an image at the same time. This 
can 
provide a smoother user experience. Note, however, to enable manipulation,&nbsp; you 
must disable gesture, and manipulation must be used together with raw touch 
messages. In the WM_TOUCH message handler, after you call GetTouchInputInfo to 
get the touch points information, you call 
ManipulationProcessor::ProcessDown/Move/Up methods, respectively. Manipulation 
does not have its own messages. You need to create a class that implements 
_IManipulationEvents. The ManipulationProcessor::ProcessDown/Move/Up methods 
will callback to this class. For more information, please refer to the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd940545(VS.85).aspx">
MTManipulation sample</a> in the Windows SDK. Note this is different from 
managed code. In managed code, the WPF manipulation APIs have written almost 
everything for you, and you only need to handle several manipulation events.</p>
<p>Inertia allow you to &quot;throw&quot; an object on the screen. Imagine you&#39;re moving 
an image. After you release your finger, the image can still move for a short 
amount of time. The velocity will become lower and lower and eventually it 
stops. This allows you to create the acceleration/deceleration behavior. Inertia 
must be used together with manipulation. For more information, please refer to 
the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd562174(VS.85).aspx">
MTManipulationInertia sample</a> in the Windows SDK.</p>
<h4>Mouse simulation</h4>
<p>Finally, when building a multi-touch enabled application, please bare in mind 
that lots of users do not have a touch screen yet. So you should provide 
alternative ways to interact with your application. In order to provide a clean 
code file, this sample does not handle mouse messages. Instead, it creates some 
simple ribbon commands that allows you to do some basic navigation, such as translate left 100 pixels, scale up 10%, rotate 
left 90 degrees, etc. Ribbon allows you to separate UI markup with application 
logic in your native application, similar to WPF/Silverlight. If you&#39;re 
interested in the ribbon part of the sample, please refer to Ribbon.xml, 
Application.h/cpp, CommandHandler.h/cpp.</p>
<h3>Integrate multi-touch with Direct2D</h3>
<p>To build a modern application with great user experience, it is recommended 
to use modern graphic frameworks such as Direct2D and WIC. WIC allows you to 
encode/decode bitmaps very efficiently, but it doesn&#39;t have much to do with 
multi-touch. Direct2D allows you to transform rendered objects such as images. 
So the following document focuses on Direct2D.</p>
<p>Direct2D provides standard transform operations. Multi-touch gestures is 
intended to transform the object. But the names used in Direct2D and multi-touch 
are different. The following table compares the names.</p>
<table class="BorderedTable">
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style1">Direct2D Transforms</td>
		<td class="auto-style1">Multi-Touch Gestures</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style1">Translate</td>
		<td class="auto-style1">Pan</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style1">Scale</td>
		<td class="auto-style1">Zoom</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style1">Rotate</td>
		<td class="auto-style1">Rotate</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="auto-style1">Skew</td>
		<td class="auto-style1">No pre-defined gestures</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
<p>As you can see, Direct2D transforms are named after WPF/Silverlight 
transforms, while multi-touch gestures provide more friendly names to end users.</p>
<p>The data in the Pan and Zoom gesture can be translated to Direct2D&#39;s 
Translate and Scale transforms directly. But Rotate can&#39;t. In Direct2D, a 
positive angle results in a clockwise rotation, which is consistent with WPF and 
Silverlight. But the rotate gesture assumes a positive angle results in a 
counter-clockwise rotation, which is consistent with GDI. So we must get the 
opposite number. In addition, Direct2D&#39;s rotate transform uses degrees instead 
of radians. So we must convert the radians angle to a degree angle.</p>
<p>Multi-touch doesn&#39;t provide a standard skew gesture. In this sample, we use 
the TwoFingerTap and PressAndTap gestures to toggle the skew transform.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to the OnGesture and 
OnTranslate/Scale/Rotate methods.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the future, natural inputs such as multi-touch, camera, and voice will 
become more and more popular. We&#39;re no longer living in a world where computer 
input only supports mouse and keyboard. To build future aware applications, you 
should consider to optimize your application for new input solutions such as 
multi-touch, camera, and voice.</p>
<p>Windows 7 provides out of box support for multi-touch input. You can work 
with touch devices from both native applications and managed applications. 
Managed applications are much easier to write because of the robust framework 
provided by WPF. But using native code allows you to easily take advantage of 
the latest Windows 7 features that have not been exposed via managed APIs, such 
as Direct2D.</p>
