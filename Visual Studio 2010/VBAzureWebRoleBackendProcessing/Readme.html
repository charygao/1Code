<h1>WINDOWS AZURE APPLICATION : VBAzureWebRoleBackendProcessing Project Overview</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Visual Studio 2010. The trial version can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/try">Visual Studio 2010 Trial Downloads</a></li>
    <li>Windows Azure SDK which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/sdk/">Download Windows Azure SDK</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Windows Azure provides a worker role to perform backend processing. A worker role 
    will be deployed to one or more separated instances. However, sometimes we want to perform 
    backend processing in the same instance of web role for cost saving purpose etc.</p>

    
    <p>This sample shows how to achieve this goal by using 
        startup task in a web role to run a console application in the backend. The 
        backend processor works much similar to a worker role. The difference is that it 
        runs as a startup task in the same instance of the web role.</p>

    <p>Please note if a VM crashes both the frontend 
    web role and the backend processor on the VM stop working, and the scalability 
    of the backend processor is coupled with scalability of the web role, which may 
    not be suitable in some scenario.</p>

<p>This solution contains 4 projects:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Common</b> is a Class Library that acts as both data access layer and bussiness 
        layer. DataSources class, WordDataContext class, WordEntry are for accessing 
        Table Storage and Queue Storage. BackendProcessor class contains the logic that 
        will be run in backend. </li>
    <li><b>Processor</b> is a Console Application that runs the backend logic.</li>
    <li><b>WebRole</b> is a Web Role project that contains a web page to demo this sample.</li>
    <li><b>AzureService</b> is a Windows Azure Service project that configures the web role and 
        the startup task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to demo this sample</h2>

<h3>How to run this sample on local machine</h3>

<p>Please open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 in Administrator mode, set AzureService project as startup 
    project and press F5 (or click &quot;Start Debugging&quot; from Debug menu).The browser will be 
    opened automatically and will be displaying a sample web page.</p>

<p>
    Please input some words into the text box and press the Process button. The 
    words will be added to Azure Table Storage. Then later, these words will be 
    processed to be upper case by a backend processor. </p>

<h3>How to debug this sample locally</h3>
<p>Please temporarily comment out Startup element from 
    ServiceDefinition.csdef file.Press F5 to start debugging the web role. For now, 
    the Processor is not started up. When the web role is running, please right 
    click the Processor project in Solution Explorer window and click Debug -&gt; Start new instance. Now you are 
    debugging both the WebRole project and the Processor project.</p>

<h3>How to publish this sample to the cloud</h3>
<p>Open the solution in Visual Studio 2010 in Administrator mode. Right click the AzureService project 
    in Solution Explorer window and 
    click Publish. Please see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee460772.aspx">
    Publishing a Windows Azure Application from Visual Studio</a> for more information. 
    </p>
    <p>Please make sure you have a valid storage account when you test the application published to cloud. 
        To change the connection string, please open up <a href="https://windows.azure.com/">Azure Platform Management Portal</a>, 
        select the published service project, and click the <b>Configure</b> button. In the 
        <b>Configure Deployment</b> dialog, select <b>Edit current configuration</b> and edit the 
        DataConnectionString setting as followed:</p>
<pre>
&lt;Setting name=&quot;DataConnectionString&quot; value=&quot;<b>DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=[YourAccountName];AccountKey=[YourAccountKey]</b>&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Key Logic</h2>

<h3>useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy</h3>
<p>The Processor project relies on Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime assembly 
    which is a mixed mode assembly. The useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy attribute 
    is required for referencing any mixed mode assembly.So the configuration file Processor project contains the following setting:</p>
<pre>
&lt;startup <b>useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy=&quot;true&quot;</b>&gt;
    &lt;supportedRuntime version=&quot;v4.0&quot; sku=&quot;.NETFramework,Version=v4.0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/startup&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Use a console application within the same solution in startup task</h3>
<p>Firstly create the Processor console application in the same solution. Then in 
    the WebRole project, add a reference to the console application project.Adding 
    the reference will cause the console application to be built and copied to 
    the output folder of WebRole project when a build action is applied to WebRole 
    project.</p>
    <p>By default, when we add reference to a project, the application configuration 
        file will not be copied to the target output folder.To overcome this, we create 
        a second config file called 
        VBAzureWebRoleBackendProcessing.Processor.exe.config 
        (VBAzureWebRoleBackendProcessing.Processor.exe is the file name of the console 
        application) in the console project. Set <b>Copy to Output Directory</b> as <b>Copy 
        always.</b> This configuration file will be used when the console application is 
        loaded as startup task by the web role.</p>
    <p>In AzureService project, open ServiceDefinition.csdef file. Add a Startup element 
        within WebRole element to start up the the console application.</p>
<pre>
&lt;Startup&gt;
    &lt;Task commandLine=&quot;VBAzureWebRoleBackendProcessing.Processor.exe&quot; executionContext=&quot;elevated&quot; taskType=&quot;background&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/Startup&gt;
</pre>
